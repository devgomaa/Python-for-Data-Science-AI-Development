# Python for Data Science, AI & Development

## Overview

Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods and algorithms to extract clean information from raw data for the formulation of actionable insights. The Data Science field is growing rapidly and revolutionizing many industries. Data Science has incalculable benefits in business, research, and our everyday lives. Your route to work, your most recent Google search for the nearest coffee shop, your Instagram post about what you ate, and even the health data from your fitness tracker are all important to different data scientists in different ways.

Sifting through massive lakes of data, looking for connections and patterns, data science is responsible for bringing us new products, delivering breakthrough insights, and making our lives more convenient.
